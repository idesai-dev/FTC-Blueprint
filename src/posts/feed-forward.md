Feedforward control is a pro-active way of controlling mechanisms. Unlike PID, which reacts to errors, Feedforward uses a model of the physical system to pre-calculate the power needed to achieve a specific movement.

## Why use Feedforward?
With PID alone, if you have gravity or friction (like an arm or linear slide), the mechanism will likely sag or drop. You would have to use a high $K_i$ to compensate, which makes the robot slower to respond.

Feedforward calculates the exact amount of power needed to maintain a certain position (against gravity) or speed (against friction).

### 1. Velocity Feedforward ($K_v$)
This is the amount of power needed per unit of velocity.
- **Output** = *K_v* × **target velocity**

### 2. Static Friction Feedforward ($K_s$)
This is the "voltage jump" needed to overcome friction and get the robot moving.
- **Output** = *K_s* (sign stays consistent with direction)

### 3. Gravity Feedforward ($K_g$)
Crucial for arms and slides.
- **For a linear slide:** Constant $K_g$ to hold the weight.
- **For a rotating arm:** *K_g* × cos(θ) where θ is the arm's angle.

## Implementation in FTC

Here is how you can implement a standard Feedforward calculation for a linear slide:

```java
public class SlideFeedforward {
    private double ks, kg, kv, ka;

    public SlideFeedforward(double ks, double kg, double kv, double ka) {
        this.ks = ks;
        this.kg = kg;
        this.kv = kv;
        this.ka = ka;
    }

    public double calculate(double velocity, double acceleration) {
        return (ks * Math.signum(velocity)) + kg + (kv * velocity) + (ka * acceleration);
    }
}
```

## Combined PID and Feedforward
In a real FTC robot, you should use **PID + Feedforward**. The Feedforward does the "heavy lifting" by getting you near the target, and the PID handles the small corrections.

```java
double ff_power = feedforward.calculate(target_vel, target_accel);
double pid_power = pid.calculate(current_position);

motor.setPower(ff_power + pid_power);
```

## Tuning Feedforward
If your robot has Roadrunner or Pedro Pathing, they come with built-in tuning tools for $K_s$ and $K_v$ for the drivetrain. For your custom mechanisms, start with $K_s$ (the minimum power to move the mechanism), then $K_v$ (the relation between power and steady velocity), and finally $K_g$ (the power to hold it still).

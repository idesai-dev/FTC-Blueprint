# Tuning Your Robot for Pedro Pathing

Tuning is the most critical part of setting up Pedro Pathing. A well-tuned robot will follow paths with high precision, while a poorly tuned one will struggle.

## The Tuning Process

### 1. Drivetrain Tuning
- **Max Velocity:** Find the maximum speed your robot can achieve while maintaining control.
- **Acceleration:** Find the maximum acceleration the robot should use for smooth movements.

### 2. Odometry Calibration
- **Encoder Resolution:** Ensure your odometry pods are providing the correct number of pulses per unit of distance.
- **Track Width:** Precisely measure the physical distance between your tracking wheels.

### 3. PID and Feedforward Tuning
- **Follower PID:** Tune the PID controllers within Pedro to maintain path accuracy.
- **Feedforward Constants:** Find the *K_s*, *K_v*, and *K_a* values for your drivetrain motors.

## Using Panels
Pedro Pathing includes a built-in dashboard for real-time tuning and visualization. 

1.  Connect to your robot's Control Hub via Wi-Fi.
2.  Open the Pedro Dashboard in your web browser.
3.  Use the tuning tools to adjust constants and see the robot's performance live.

## Common Issues
- **Overshooting:** Increase K_d or decrease K_p in your follower PID.
- **Inconsistent Paths:** Check your odometry hardware for any mechanical issues.
- **Slow Response:** Increase your K_p or K_v values.
